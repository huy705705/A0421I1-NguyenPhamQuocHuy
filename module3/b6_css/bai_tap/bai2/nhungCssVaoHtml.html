    <p style="color: blue;">The Sophen country had been destroyed by the empire.
        The sole daughter of a count family, Leylin Efran,
        had to find a husband to be able to inherit her family. So she wouldn’t have to suffer through loveless
         marriage, Leylin decided to find a husband to have a one-year contract marriage with. In the middle of her quest, 
         a young and dashing man appeared before her. Leylin was convinced this is the right man for her, but is he truly the answer
          to Leylin’s perilous situation?</p>
